content-name: Case Study of an app called "GenderSafe", designed by Tessa Sherin-Snidal.
about: GenderSafe is a local network that enables women in the workplace to get their issues out anonymously. It is designed for women facing gender inequality and harassment in their professional workplace; whether it be physical, verbal, and/or environmental. Working women need access to anonymity and unbiased support, because they are afraid of the repercussions if they speak up to talk.
