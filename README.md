Tessa Sherin-Snidal

Solving problems in a constructive and creative way it's what gets me out of bed in the morning. Graphic Design being the encompassment of all this makes me love every day of my profession. It drives me to better myself and the world around me.

I have always loved art, but have never been able to just make something attractive without a purpose. I have always been driven to make the creations in my world attractive and solve the issues facing usability.
