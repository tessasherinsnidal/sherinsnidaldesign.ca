Tessa Sherin-Snidal

The opportunity to solve problems in a constructive, and creative way is what gets me out of bed in the morning. Graphic Design provides me these opportunities and I love every day I am able to practice my profession. It drives me to better myself, and the world around me.

I have always loved art, but have never been able to just make something attractive without a purpose. Through my art I am able to solve usability issues facing our everyday life.
