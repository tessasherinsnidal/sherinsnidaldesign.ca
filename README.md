Tessa Sherin-Snidal

Solving problems in a constructive and creative way is what gets me out of bed in the morning. Having Graphic Design be the encompassment of all this is what makes me love every day of my profession. It drives me to better myself and the world around me.

I have always loved art, but have never been able to just make something attractive. i have always been driven to make the things in my world attractive and solve the issues facing usability.
