    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="about">Solving problems in a constructive and creative way is what gets me out of bed in the morning, because Graphic Design is comprised of all that i need to love every day of my profession. It drives me to better myself, and the world around me.<br><br>I have always loved art, but have never been able to solely make something attractive without a purpose. I have always been driven to make the creations in my world more attractive to solve the usability issues facing our everyday life.</p>
