content: An illustration of a quotebook called "Guy Ritchie"
about: A quotebook designed about Guy Ritchie’s movies, his strongest characters and their quotes in those movies. Each section of the book is unique and different, unfolding in different ways, just like the plots of Guy Ritchie’s movies — unique and complicated, yet magnanimous. Each character is made out of their own quotes from the movie —, what makes them who there are and such strong characters.
