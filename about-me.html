      Hi, my name is Tessa. I am a Graphic Designer who loves everything about her job and its amazing benefits. I started off my schooling thinking I wanted to be an artist, but, as it turns out, I found it lacking something to hold my interest and passion. I found this missing piece within Graphic Design, I am inspired by the correlation of Art and Problem-solving. The simplicity of having something clean and beautiful that serves the public, to aid them in their daily life.
